📝 Notable Examples
Here are a few highlighted files with common data structure operations and sorting methods:

AlfredoVargas_5929578_BubbleSort_10_05_25.cpp
• Demonstrates a simple Bubble Sort in descending order.
• Prompts the user for the array size, fills it with random numbers, then sorts it.

AlfredoVargas_5929578_practice8_DS.cpp
• Defines a my_Array class with dynamic allocation.
• Illustrates Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, and Selection Sort.
• Shows how to insert, display, and manipulate array elements using member functions.

AlfredoVargas_5929578_practice6_DS.cpp
• Example of basic array operations:

Creating an array
Inserting elements
Deleting elements
Performing linear search
searching.cpp
• Contains a basic linear search implementation using C++ STL vectors.

insertionSort.cpp
• More focused example of an Insertion Sort implementation.

🔧 Usage & Customization
You can adapt the array size, change the input source, or recycle any function to suit your own needs. Some files demonstrate multiple operations on arrays, so feel free to copy, modify, or extend them for your projects.
